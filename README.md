# devops-assignment: Helm template to deploy a sample python application into Kubernetes

**This is not a production-grade chart. It is an example.**

You can deploy this chart with `helm install devops-assignment-03`. Or
you can see how this chart would render with `helm install --dry-run
--debug devops-assignment-03`.
